# Text Classification with Pre-trained Model README

## Overview

This project demonstrates how I implemented a basic text classification script using a pre-trained model. The script classifies input text into different categories using a model trained on a specific task, such as sentiment analysis or topic classification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `transformers` library
- `torch` library

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```
   pip install transformers torch
   ```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Open a command line interface (e.g., Command Prompt, Terminal) and run the script using the following command:

   ```
   python text_classification.py
   ```

4. The script will execute and classify the provided input text. Results will be printed to the console.

## Description

- `text_classification.py`: Python script that implements text classification using a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. It loads a pre-trained model and tokenizer, defines input text, classifies the text, and prints the results.

## Customization

- You can modify the input text in the script to classify your own text samples.
- To use a different pre-trained model or task, you can adjust the `model` parameter when creating the pipeline.
